BPMN v2 compliant BPM engine on Go

# Overview

**gobpm** is a BPM engine aimed of BPMN v.2 processes. It should support 
modeling, loading/saving and executing BPMN v2 processes.

**gobpm** should comply for BPMN Process Execution Conformance. That means the 
gobpm MUST fully support and interpret the operational semantics and Activity 
life-cycle, MUST fully support and interpret the underlying metamodel and MUST 
support import of BPMN Process diagram types including its definitional 
Collaboration.

Main goal -- make it functional and easy to use for Gophers not for business 
analytics. 

It shuld be deisgned as a library not as a framework to minimize amount of 
restrictions for developers.
