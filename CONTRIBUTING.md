# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers and testers to help this project come to fruition.

Here are some important resources:

  * Mailing list: Join our [developer list](http://groups.google.com/group/gobpm/)
  * Bugs are tracking as [GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues). Before reporting an issue please check the [Issue list](https://github.com/dr-dobermann/gobpm/issues) if there is no one issue similar to yours.</br>Please give as much information about the issue as possible: 
  
    - Description
    - Step to reproduce
      - 1.
      - 2.
    - Expected behavior
    - Actual behavior

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to opengovernment](https://github.com/dr-dobermann/gobpm/compare) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Since the gobpm native language is Go there is nothing better than using of coding convention described in [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go) article.

Thanks,
Ruslan Gabitov
